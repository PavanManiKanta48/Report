Constructors :
             It is a special method present inside a class responsible for initializing the variables of that class.

Properties : In order to encapsulate and protect the data members (i.e. fields or variables) of a class, we use properties in C#.
             The Properties in C# are used as a mechanism to set and get the values of data members of a class outside of that class.

Methods :   A method is a code block that contains a series of statements. A program causes the statements to be executed by calling 
            the method and specifying any required method arguments.
