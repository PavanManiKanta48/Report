polymorphism : gone little bit deep into polymorphism and different types of implementations. they are,
             1.Method Overloading
             2.Operator Overloading
             3.Method Overriding
             4.Method Hiding

interface : he Interface in C# is a fully un-implemented class used for declaring a set of methods of an object. So, we
            can define an interface as a pure abstract class which allows us to define only abstract methods.
            gone through how to implementit in bank.


Abstraction : 
            Abstract Method: A method without a body is known as an abstract method.
            Abstract Class: A class that contains any abstract members in it is known as an abstract class.

Static Class :
           The class which is created by using the static modifier is called a static class in C#. A static class can contain
           only static members. It is not possible to create an instance of a static class.

partial Class :

           we can physically split the content of the class into different files but even physically they are divided but 
           logically it is one single unit only.
