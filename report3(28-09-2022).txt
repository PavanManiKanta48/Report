                                  Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) in C#
Class :    A class is simply a user-defined data type that represents both state and behavior.

Objects : 
          It is an instance of a class. A class is brought live by creating objects. An object can be considered as a thing
          that can perform activities.

Constructor  :
          It is a special method present inside a class responsible for initializing the variables of that class. We will come
          to this point later part of this article.
          There are five types of constructors available. they are

          1.Default or Parameter Less Constructor
          2.Parameterized Constructor
          3.Copy Constructor
          4.Static Constructor
          5.Private Constructor

Inheritance :
          Inheritance in C# is a mechanism of consuming the members that are defined in one class from another class.
   
Polymorphism :
          polymorphism means “many forms” .
Method Overloading : this can be done with same Method name but different Parameters

Method Overriding : Creating a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base class is called as method overriding.
